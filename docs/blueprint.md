## Core Features:

- Notification Receiver: Receive and log FCM notifications to the console.
- Foreground Display: Display foreground notifications as in-app pop-ups using Nextjs.
- Background Verification: Verify background notifications via the system tray or in-app logs.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft teal (#4db6ac) for a clean and calming feel, evoking trust.
- Background color: Light gray (#f0f4c3) for a clean, unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: A muted blue (#7986cb) to complement the teal without overpowering it.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font that conveys modernity, for a clean and readable UI.
- Use simple, line-based icons to match the clean aesthetic.
- Maintain a clean, minimalist layout with plenty of white space for clarity.
- Incorporate subtle, non-distracting animations for user interactions.
